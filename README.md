[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jyang772/Tic-Tac-Toe.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Jyang772/Tic-Tac-Toe)

Tic-Tac-Toe with simple GUI. The AI plays the "perfect" game, always resulting in a draw or the computer winning. 
The computer _always_ seeks to maximize it's score. While _minimizing_ the player's score by multiplying it by -1.

A move that will benefit the player with a positive score, will be the computer's worse move. 

Will add better graphics and ability to play multiplayer games. 

_"The only winning move is not to play."_
